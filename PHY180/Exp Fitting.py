"""
This program imports data from the file specified by the string filename
The first line of the file is ignored (assuming it's the name of the variables)
After that the data file needs to be formatted: 
number space number space number space number newline
Do NOT put commas in your data file!!
The data file should be in the same directory as this python file
The data should be in the order:
x_data y_data x_uncertainty y_uncertainty

Then this program tries to fit a function to the data points
It plots the data as dots with errorbars and the best fit line
It then prints the best fit information
After that, it plots the "residuals": ydata - fittedfunction(xdata)
That is it subtracts your fitted ideal values from your actual data to see 
what is "left over" from the fit
Ideally your residuals graph should look like noise, otherwise there is more
information you could extract from your data (or you used the wrong fitting
function)
